# Focus One

Focus One is a minimal daily focus app built with Flutter. The goal of the app is simple: help users choose one meaningful priority per day, work on it in focused sessions, and reflect at the end of the day.

Instead of managing long task lists or complex productivity systems, Focus One is intentionally opinionated. It encourages clarity, intention, and consistency by limiting the user to a single daily focus and lightweight reflection.

## Concept

Many productivity apps overwhelm users with features, metrics, and endless to-do lists. Focus One takes the opposite approach by reducing friction and cognitive load. Each day starts fresh, with one focus, a few focused sessions, and a short reflection.

The app is designed to feel calm, purposeful, and distraction-free.

## Features

- Set one daily focus with an optional reason
- Run focused work sessions with a simple timer
- Log session duration and quick feedback
- End-of-day reflection to capture outcomes and insights
- View recent history with completed days and total focus time
- Offline-first using local storage only

## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- GoRouter for navigation
- Riverpod for state management
- Local persistence (offline-first)
- Material 3 theming

## Project Status

This project is actively being developed as a focused portfolio piece to demonstrate clean Flutter architecture, thoughtful UX decisions, and the ability to ship a polished, real-world app within a limited scope.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
